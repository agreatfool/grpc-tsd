grpc-tsd
========

## Attention
Current gRPC(v1.3.7) has no official TypeScript definition. But shall have one soon, see: [#11020](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11020). This repo would be `Deprecated` as soon as official d.ts online.

## Code base
Codes mostly comes from [#11020](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11020), and a bit from [mixer/etcd3](https://github.com/mixer/etcd3/blob/master/src/types/grpc.d.ts). And partly self updated.

## Aim
Maintain a grpc.d.ts file for gRPC TypeScript project.
